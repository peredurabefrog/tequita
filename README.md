# Tequita - the littlest library system
The main purposes of this project are to:
* refresh my programming skills.
* learn how to use CakePHP.
* perhaps, build a working library management system.

There may be other small library automation systems around. I really have no 
idea, but the full-blown systems I have met are monstrous.

This system, if it has any use at all, would be for small libraries such as:
* community libraries run by volunteers
* small private libraries or collections

Tequita should be immediately usable to untrained users with no previous
experience of library work and no qualifications in librarianship.

Initially, the project should cover:
* Data entry for stock items including books, serials, computer files, etc.
* OPAC with the ability to search all relevant fields from the above.
* Security, to only permit changes to be made by users with the proper credentials
* Updating and deleting stock records.
* Exporting data to MARC21 and JSON formats.
* Aggregating exported records into a single file for OPAC display or for exchange.
