# Tequita - the littlest library system
The main purposes of this project are to:
* refresh my programming skills.
* learn how to use CakePHP.
* perhaps, build a working library management system.

There may be other small library automation systems around. I really have no 
idea, but the full-blown systems I have met are monstrous.

This system, if it has any use at all, would be for small libraries such as:
* community libraries run by volunteers
* small private libraries or collections
